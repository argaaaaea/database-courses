# database-courses
The cims is an application that my team made for fulfilling the last project task for database courses. My team use django framework to build the app and use PostgreSQL for the databases. The application did not focus on the Front-end side of the web but the main focus is how my team can connect our django app with our  databases and how to do query in django.
